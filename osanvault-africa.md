# ÒsánVault Africa Grant Application

## Project Name
ÒsánVault Africa

## Project Overview
ÒsánVault Africa is a **tokenized real estate platform** built on the Solana blockchain that allows users to invest in fractionalized property assets through our native **NigeriaEstate Token (NET)**.

Key highlights:  
- Fractional ownership of properties via blockchain  
- NET token with staking, swap, and real-yield distribution  
- DAO-lite governance allowing community voting on property acquisitions and platform decisions  
- Web3-enabled Glide app for mobile and web users  
- Referral and community incentive programs  
- NFT certificates for property ownership
